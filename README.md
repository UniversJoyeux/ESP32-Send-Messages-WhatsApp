# ESP32-Send-Messages-WhatsApp
This example demonstrates how to send messages to WhatsApp using ESP32 along with Arduino IDE. For this to work we should install WhatsApp and Arduino IDE, and acquire ESP32 microcontroller.

## Steps for Getting the CallMeBot API KEY
To send messages to your WhatsApp account with the ESP32, weâ€™ll use a free API service called CallMeBot service.
* [CallMeBot](https://www.callmebot.com/blog/free-api-whatsapp-messages/)
* Instructions:
1. Add the phone number +34 684 73 40 44 into your Phone Contacts. (Name it it as you wish)
2. Send this message "I allow callmebot to send me messages" to the new Contact created (using WhatsApp of course)
3. Wait until you receive the message "API Activated for your phone number. Your APIKEY is 123123" from the bot.
Note: If you don't receive the ApiKey in 2 minutes, please try again after 24hs.
The WhatsApp message from the bot will contain the apikey needed to send messages using the API.

## How to Use Example

* How to install the Arduino IDE: [Install Arduino IDE](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/tree/master/docs/arduino-ide).

#### Using Arduino IDE

* Before Compile/Verify, select the correct board: `Tools -> Board`.
* Select the COM port: `Tools -> Port: xxx` where the `xxx` is the detected COM port.

#### Using Platform IO

* Select the COM port: `Devices` or setting the `upload_port` option on the `platformio.ini` file.

## Troubleshooting

***Important: Be sure you're using a good quality USB cable and you have enough power source for your project.***

* **Programming Fail:** If the programming/flash procedure fails, try to reduce the serial connection speed.
* **COM port not detected:** Check the USB cable connection and the USB to Serial driver installation.

If the error persist, you can ask help at the official [ESP32 forum](https://esp32.com) or see [Contribute](#contribute).
